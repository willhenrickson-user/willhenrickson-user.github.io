            <p>Here are two examples of projects I have completed during my time at CU Boulder that I believe are indicative of my technical skills and interests.</p>

            <h4>Project 1: Using Spotify Data to Determine what Makes a Song Danceable.</h4>
            <a href="Project_1.png"><img src="Project_1.png" alt="Project 1 Image"></a>
            <p>This project involved pulling 100 songs from 6 different musical genres through the Spotify API and using the built in analysis features to figure out how Spotify determines the danceability of a song using data analysis.</p><br>

            <h4>Project 2: Using Data Visualizations to Compare Drunk Driving Arrest to Liquor Lisence Holders.</h4>
            <a href="Project_2.png"><img src="Project_2.png" alt="Project 2 Image"></a>
            <p>Completed as a group, this project involved retrieving both DUI arrest incidents and liquor liscnese owners in both Boulder and Denver to determine if there was a relationship between alcohol vendors and drunk driving incidents.</p><br>
